When contributing, I ask that you do the following:

* Use `black` code formatter on all edited files.
* Edit requirements.txt as needed.
* All needed dependencies should be compatible with `poetry`.
* Limit use of dependencies when possible.
* Stay consistent with the current layout/design. (Double quotes, uppercase constants, underscores, etc.)
* If using OS sensitive code, make sure to design for Unix or provide a counterpart.

Note that your PR will likely be accepted even if it doesn't meet this criteria, but please follow it to the best of your abilities.

I really appreciate your help!
